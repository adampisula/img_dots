# img_dots
Styling a picture with dots.

###How to use it:
* Compile the program using `xbuild` or an ordinary compiler like the one in Visual Studio.
* Run the `img_dots/bin/Debug/img_dots.exe` program with `mono img_dots.exe` or (if you're on Windows) just double-click it.
* Set desired square and circle size.
* Select photo from your file system.
* Click start.
